# Research papers, Reports and Smaller ML Projects
This is a collection of some smaller ML projects and writing samples (i.e. research papers, reports, presentations) that I've worked on throughout my learning journey.

- [The Effects of Errors in a Randomized Design Setting of Linear Regression](https://github.com/tl-lay/research-papers-and-reports/tree/2e9c90dd945a26653a93189e38691317a9575e84/The%20Effects%20of%20Errors%20in%20a%20Randomized%20Design%20Setting%20of%20Linear%20Regression): Research paper exploring the nature of linear regression in a random design setting, largely inspired by the theorems established by **Daniel Hsu, Sham M. Kakade, and Tong Zhang** in their paper [**_Random Design Analysis of Ridge Regression_**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.2363). Under mild assumptions in the random design setting, they established explicit bounds to prediction error for regression estimators which revealed a close connection between the random and fixed design settings.
- [Waste Classification with Computer Vision](https://github.com/tl-lay/research-papers-and-reports/tree/2e9c90dd945a26653a93189e38691317a9575e84/Waste%20Classification%20with%20Computer%20Vision): Fine-tuning different pre-trained image classification models for the purpose of classifying types of household garbage such as glass, e-waste, organic materials and plastics.
